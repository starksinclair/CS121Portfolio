### Project 1: Pokemon Game

This project is a Pokemon-themed game developed in Java. Players can capture, battle, and destroy each other Pokemon. 

### Project 2: School Grading Application

The school grading application allows you to see which grades and average scores, a person got in a semester. Built in Java.

### Project 3: Banking Management System

This banking management system is designed to simulate banking operations. It allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, and view account balances. It uses ArrayList for the data structure.

### Activity 1: JSON/XML Tutorial

This activity provides a quick overview of how to use JSON and XML in Java applications. It covers parsing, writing, and converting between these formats and Java objects. This is essential for any developer looking to handle data interchange in their applications.

### Activity 2: Greatest Common Denominator

This activity demonstrates the use of both iterative (for/while loops) and recursive methods in Java to find the greatest common denominator (GCD) of two numbers. It's a great way to understand different approaches to solving the same problem using basic control structures in Java.
